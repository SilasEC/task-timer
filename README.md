Task Timer
==

Description
-

This is a simple timer coded in python that allows the user to stop and start tasks to time how long they took. It also displays what task is currently running. The user can also print a summary of their time sheet. It uses a json file to store data between calls. Formatting and color is done via rich. Multiple tasks can be run at a time.

Usage

There are commands to create new tasks, finish ongoing ones, view a timesheet of tasks with their elapsed times, and clear all tasks. The timesheet shows all tasks by default, but you can optionally choose to just see finished or just see ongoing ones. To make a new task you must input a name for the task, and to finish a task you must specify which one. Clearing has no arguments or options. To see exactly how to use these commands, use --help.
